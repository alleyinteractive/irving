# Zephr Rule Components

This folder contains the components that map to areas of the page where editors can make output decisions based on conditions defined in the Zephr admin.

To see the list of defined components, the corresponding code in the WordPress project is [themes/mittr/inc/api/models/ZephrComponents.php](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/mittr-wp/blob/master/themes/mittr/inc/api/models/ZephrComponents.php).

This documentation will be updated with more information on how to add components and manage styling them.
