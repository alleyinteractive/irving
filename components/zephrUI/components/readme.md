# Zephr components

The components in this folder are not served through the Irving application. Instead, they are styled and documented here so that they can be pasted and served [through the Zephr feature rules](https://technologyreview-staging.admin.blaize.io/v3/console/#/site-integration/resources).

All components in this folder are parsed via UIComponent.js. This component contains the logic to insert the returned component as HTML. Any tags and attributes that need to be allowed must be whitelisted in that component.
