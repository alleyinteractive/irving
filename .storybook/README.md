# Storybook

This is the storybook setup for the Styled Components package.

It's important you run these commands from the root Irving repo, and not the Styled Components package.

* `styled-components-storybook` - Run the storybook locally on port 6006.
* `build-styled-components-storybook` - Build the static storybook in `.storybook-styled-components`.
* `deploy-styled-components-storybook` - Deploy the storybook using Surge to styled-components-storybook.irvingjs.com.
* `release-storybooks` - Build and deploy all storybooks (Styled Components only for now).
