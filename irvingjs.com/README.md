# Irving landing page

An [Eleventy|https://www.11ty.dev/] site for irvingjs.com.

## Usage

Install dependencies and start the build.

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `start` script will open the page with BrowserSync and refresh when changes are detected.

To build the production-ready pages, run `npm run build`.

To test the build and verify production values prior to deploy, run `npm test`. This will re-build the site and serve the built files.
