You may provide a credit, debit, or payment account number, or other payment information, as well as your name, telephone number(s), email and/or street address.

You agree, represent, warrant, covenant and guarantee that all Registration Information provided by you is true, accurate, complete, up-to-date, and solely yours.

You may not sub-license, transfer, sell, rent or assign your Registration Information to any third party without our written approval. You agree to keep your password confidential and will be responsible for all use of your account and password. We reserve the right at any time to remove, reclaim, or change a username or avatar you select if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such username or avatar is inappropriate, obscene, or otherwise objectionable. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password to access the Site, and you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your password. You agree to immediately change your password and notify us here if you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or any other breach of security related to the Site. We reserve the right to require you to alter your password if we believe that your password is no longer secure. You agree that we will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to adequately safeguard your password or someone else’s use of your account.</p>
<p><strong>Subscription Services</strong></p>
<p>Certain services may be available only through creation of a subscription account and payment of a fee (<strong>“Subscription Services”</strong>), which may be accomplished through a third-party service provider. Through such Subscription Services accounts, you will have access to the Subscription Services for a fixed term, which will not renew automatically unless otherwise disclosed to you when you pay for the Subscription Services. You are not authorized to access any Subscription Services unless you have opened a subscription account and paid the appropriate fee, have received access credentials (e.g., a username and password) from us, and are using those access credentials. You may not assist anyone else in accessing Subscription Services on an unauthorized basis, including by sharing your access credentials or providing any content or other materials that you obtained through Subscription Services to third parties. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access credentials and for all usage or activity on your Subscription Services accounts, including the use of Subscription Services by any third party authorized by you to use your access credentials. Such responsibility expressly includes any purchases made or other charges incurred on your credit card in connection with your use (or an authorized third party’s use) of the Subscription Services. In the event of any fraudulent, abusive or otherwise illegal activity on your Subscription Services accounts, we may, in our sole discretion, terminate those accounts and refer you to appropriate law enforcement agencies. You may be responsible for damages from any such fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity. By subscribing to a Subscription Service, you confirm that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age, that all information you submit is true and correct (including all credit card information), and that you are the authorized holder of the credit card. You agree to pay all subscription fees and other charges to your Subscription Services accounts, including any applicable taxes. Company and/or the particular service provider utilized by Company or otherwise incorporated into the Subscription Service reserves the right to change the amount of, or the basis for determining, any subscription fees or other charges for the Subscription Services and to institute new subscription fees or other charges. If fees cannot be charged to the payment method you designate, or payment is returned to us for any reason, including charge back, we reserve the right, in addition to our other remedies, to: (i) demand immediate payment of all outstanding fees due to us from you; (ii) assess an additional 1.5 percent late charge, or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower; (iii) take any and all lawful steps necessary to collect fees owed to us, and you will be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with such collection activity, including collection fees, court costs, and attorneys' fees; (iv) charge such fees to any other payment method you have on file with us and/or our third-party service providers; and (v) terminate, discontinue, suspend, and/or restrict your account/profile, your ability to access, visit and/or use the Site or any portion thereof, and/or the Terms of Use, including without limitation any of our purported obligations hereunder. Some Subscription Services are accessible only using a particular kind of device. You should investigate Subscription Services before you pay for access to them to ensure that they will work with your device because we will not refund any fees you paid if the Subscription Services to which you subscribe are not compatible. Also, certain Subscription Services may not be available for use in every jurisdiction, and we will not refund any fees you paid if the Subscription Services to which you subscribe are not available. For information on compatibility and availability, please visit the applicable provider’s website. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining at your own expense all equipment, hardware, software, and telephone, cable, mobile, wireless, Internet and other services necessary to access, visit and/or use the Site. If you are accessing the Site via a mobile device, your mobile carrier may charge you fees for data, text messaging, and other mobile access or communications services. We may suspend or terminate your access to Subscription Services at any time without notice to you. If we do so, you will not be responsible for fees associated with the Subscription Services after the termination becomes effective, but you will not have any other remedies against us, and we will not issue any refunds. If you have breached or violated any obligation under these Terms, you will not be entitled to any remedy. To cancel your subscription to Subscription Services, you must follow the procedures described by Company or on the applicable provider’s website. If we or the applicable provider does not list cancellation procedures for a particular Subscription Service, you must contact us at <a href="mailto:owen@alley.co">owen@alley.co</a>. We do not refund or prorate Subscription Services, or any other purchases made through the Site, for any reason. Requests to terminate subscriptions will be effective once the billing period in which we received the cancellation concludes.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Subscription Services</strong></p>
<p>You may be asked to register for certain activities in connection with the Site other than Subscription Services. When you register, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete information about yourself as requested or directed and to promptly update this information to maintain its accuracy. Company has the right to suspend or terminate any account or other registration and to refuse any and all current or future use if it suspects that such information is inaccurate or incomplete. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password and username that you are given or select, and you are responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.</p>

<p><strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong></p>

<p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Binding Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>If the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute, claim, action, cause of action, issue, or request for relief between you and Company arising out of or relating to Company, the Site, or these Terms of Use (collectively <strong>“Disputes”</strong>) through informal good faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and COMPANY are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Company over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (<strong>“AAA Consumer Rules”</strong>), both of which are available at the AAA website: <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in New York, New York. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in New York, New York, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions to Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out</strong></p>
<p>You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing us at <a href="mailto:owen@alley.co">owen@alley.co</a> and providing the requested information as follows: (1) your name; (2) the URL of Terms of Use; (3) your Address; (4) your phone number; (5) and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms of Use. The Opt-Out notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms of Use by using the Site.</p>
