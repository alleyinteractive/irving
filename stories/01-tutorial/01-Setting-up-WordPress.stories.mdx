# Setting up WordPress
In this section, we'll prepare a WordPress installation to begin working on your Irving application.

## Prerequisites
To get started, you'll a local copy of WordPress.

For the rest of this tutorial, we'll assume a [new install](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/).

## Install and activate the WP Irving plugin
Begin by downloading, installing, and activating the [WP Irving](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/wp-irving) plugin. You should immediately see a new "Irving Development" dropdown in your [admin bar](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/packages-wordpress--page#admin-bar).

You can confirm the endpoint is setup correctly by visiting `yourdomain.com/wp-json/irving/v1` and confirming a valid response,
```json
  {
  "namespace": "irving/v1",
  "routes": {
    "/irving/v1": {
      "namespace": "irving/v1",
      "methods": [...],
      "endpoints": [...],
      "_links": {...}
    },
    "/irving/v1/components": {...},
    "/irving/v1/registered-components": {...},
    "/irving/v1/purge-cache": {...}
  },
  "_links": {...}
  }
```


If you get a `rest_no_route` error, double check your plugin is activated and [pretty permalinks](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-permalinks/) are enabled.

```json
{
  "code": "rest_no_route",
  "message": "No route was found matching the URL and request method",
  "data": {
    "status": 404
  }
}
```

## Update Settings
Now that WP Iriving is installed and you have a working WordPress install, we need to tell both the frontend and backend where the other is.

### Update the `.env`
Inside your Irving application, open the `.env` file and change

`API_ROOT_URL=https://wordpress.irvingjs.com/wp-json/irving/v1`

to

`API_ROOT_URL=https://your-local-wp-site.com/wp-json/irving/v1`

You'll need to restart Irving if it's already running.

### Update the Site Address
Inside of WordPress, you'll need to [update the Site Address](https://wordpress.org/support/article/changing-the-site-url/) to the Irving application, which by default is `http://localhost:3001`.

## Confirm
Run `npm run dev` and you should see a "welcome" message.

## Irving Starter Theme



One of the ways WP Irving helps streamline development is by offering a basic templating system, mimicking the [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/).

By default, the [Components Endpoint](?path=/docs/components-components-endpoint--page) will be constructed for any given request using `.json` files in `/wp-content/your-theme/templates/` and `/wp-content/your-theme/template-parts/`.

To get you started, the [Irving Starter Theme](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/irving-starter-theme) contains a simple Irving example.

We recommend this initial scaffolding,

```
wp-content
│
└───your-theme
    │   functions.php
    │   index.php
    │   style.css
    │
    └───templates
    │       archive.json
    │       author.json
    │       defaults.json
    │       frontpage.json
    │       index.json
    │       page.json
    │       single.json
    │
    └───template-parts
            header.json
            footer.json
```
