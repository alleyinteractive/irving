# Supported WordPress Plugins
This section highlights WordPress plugins with official Irving support.

_Note: This does not mean other plugins won't work, but your mileage may vary._

## Archiveless
Hide WordPress posts from archives, which includes the index page, search results, date archives, author archives, and term lists.

[Github Repo](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/archiveless)

## Google AMP
> AMP is a web component framework and a website publishing technology developed by Google which has the mission to "provide a user-first format for web content"

* [Github Repo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/)
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_Mobile_Pages)

### Setup
* Install the [AMP plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp) and enable it.
* Flush permalinks.
* Proxy all `*/amp/` requests [(docs)](?path=/docs/features-proxies--page).

#### Meta tag
You will also need to make the AMP version of posts discoverable by [adding a `<link>` tag](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-and-measure/discovery) in the `<head>`. If you are using WP Components, the `Head` component has an `add_link()` method you can use, e.g.

```php
$head = new \WP_Components\Head();
$head->add_link( 'amphtml', get_permalink( $head->get_post_id() ) . 'amp/' );
```

_Note: Adding the meta tag will be automated in IRV-732_


## Jetpack
When enabled, WP Irving will enqueue the scripts required for [Jetpack Site Stats](https://jetpack.com/features/traffic/site-stats/).


## JWT Auth
The `wp-api/jwt-auth` plugin can be used to enable authentication on your site. This will be deprecated when OAuth (or some alternative) is officially supported in WordPress core (expected for 5.6).

* [Github repo](https://github.com/WP-API/jwt-auth)
* [Authentication in Irving](?path=/docs/features-authentication--page)


## Pico
In order to configure a Pico paywall, you'll have to follow the directions for installing and configuring the Pico WordPress plugin. The Pico integration is automatically managed by the Integrations Manager component, so once you have entered a valid Publisher ID and API Key.

[See full readme](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/irving/tree/master/packages/integrations/components/pico).

## Safe Redirect Manager
Redirects created using Safe Redirect Manager are supported. See [Redirects](?path=/docs/features-redirects--page) documentation for details.

## WPCOM Legacy Redirects
Redirects created using WPCOM Legacy Redirector are supported. See [Redirects](?path=/docs/features-redirects--page) documentation for details.

## Yoast
When enabled, the `title`, `meta`, `link`, and `script` tags generated by Yoast will be passed to your Irving application frontend.
