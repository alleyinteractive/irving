# Isomorphic Rendering/Server Side Rendering
Isomorphically-rendered apps run roughly the same code on both the servers side (node) and the client side (your web browser). This means they can render any given page in either environment (or both).

Isomorphic rendering affords Irving many advantages over an app rendered only on the client or server side. Some of the advantages are:

* **SEO**: You only have to worry about the standard SEO concerns. Google (and other search engines') crawler bots are capable of parsing JavaScript, but they're not perfect. Isomorphic rendering means that any page can be rendered by the server and returned as static HTML, just like using your CMS' built-in templating and rendering engine. This means you can focus on making your pages SEO-friendly with no added complications.
* **Performance**: Pages throughout the site load very efficiently. Irving's server will bootstrap the app with an initial payload of markup and app state. After this bootstrapping process, only the changes between one page and another will need to be handledâ€”and Irving can do so without a page refresh. What this means for your users is a fast, app-like experience navigating through your site.

# Express
Irving's express server is set up somewhat differently than you might expect from a normal express app. While a normal express app might route different requests to different handles, Irving uses a single handler for all requests. The reason for this is Irving is intended to work primarily as a drop-in replacement for a CMS's default render layer. As such, Irving relies on your CMS's built-in routing to handle requests appropriately instead of doing so on its own.

In practice, this means the only distinctions you need to be aware of in express request handling are those between `development` and `production` environments.

## Development
* Uses [`webpack-dev-middleware`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware) to directly serve webpack assets.
* [`webpack-hot-middleware`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-hot-middleware) is used to hot reload client-side assets.
* In addition, [`webpack-hot-server-middleware`](https://github.com/60frames/webpack-hot-server-middleware) is used to handle server-executed hot reloading.

## Production
* Uses the server-side webpack bundle to handle all user requests.
* Adds optional basic auth using the [`basic-auth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basic-auth) package
* Aggressively caches the client side bundle using `express.static`
