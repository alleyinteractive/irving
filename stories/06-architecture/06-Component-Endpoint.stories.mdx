# Components Endpoint
When a user hits an endpoint in Irving, the application fires a request to the CMS' API. The response is parsed by Irving and displayed to the user as rendered React components.

The components API is how your CMS describes what Irving should render for any given route. Irving will make a request to your API with a ?path query param. The value of this query param is the path currently being loaded. Navigating to /about-us/ will create a request of /components?path=/about-us/. The CMS should parse this request and return a JSON response.

You can also use context to describe the context of the API load. In Core Irving context=site will be passed for the initial load to indicate that defaults should also be included in the payload.

## Response
All responses follow this format,
```json
{
  "defaults": [],
  "page": [],
  "providers": [],
  "redirectTo": "",
  "redirectStatus": 0
}
```

* `defaults`: An array of components that informs Irving what components are "global" and should persist across all requests. This is good for setting up headers, footers, scripts, and other components that should exist on every page. Defaults can be passed at any point, but Irving will automatically add `context=site` to the initial request, which can be used as a flag to return the default components.
* `page`: An array of components for a specific route. Irving looks for top-level conflicts between the `defaults` and `page` arrays and overrides the defaults with the page component.
* `providers`: An array of components that should be used as providers. See the [RootProvider](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/irving/tree/production/components/rootProviders) component for full documentation.
* `redirectTo`: The url you want to redirect to.
* `redirectStatus`: HTTP status code for your redirect.

# Component Structure
Example,
```json
{
  "name": "irving/text",
  "_alias": "irving/text",
  "config": {
    "content": "Hello World!"
  },
  "children": []
}
```

### `name` - String
A unique slug for your component. Follows a `{namespace}/{name}` format in dash case.

### `_alias` - String (experimental)
Allows you to alias your rendering to a different component.

For example, you may have default wrappers named `irving/header-wrapper`, `irving/body-wrapper`, `irving/footer-wrapper`. Rather than creating a new componentMap entry for each one, you can render using `irving/fragment` by setting the alias property.

### `config` - Object
The config property is passed along to the React component as `props`.

### `children` - Array
An array of other components or strings that render as React components or text nodes. This gets merged into the `props` object upon rendering, and is accessible as `props.children`.
