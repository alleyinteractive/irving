# Storybook

This is an example implementation of Storybook for Irving Components. To see it in action, run `npm run storybook` and a Storybook will start up at [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006/).

We've included a sample `Heading` component in `/packages/core/components/heading` with and example story, documented using the experimental MDX syntax.
