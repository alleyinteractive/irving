# Using WordPress
Irving is purposefully built to be CMS agnostic and ignorant, but was originally envisioned and engineered to serve WordPress.

We are currently only supporting WordPress in any meaningful way.

# What is WP Irving?
WP Irving is the companion WordPress plugin to Irving. Included are various APIs, plugin integrations, and other customizations/helpers to streamline Irving development when using WordPress as the CMS. It registers the API endpoints that Irving Core expects, which you can build upon to pass your data from WordPress to the frontend.

# Example Theme

The Irving Example Theme's purpose is to demo Irving and WordPress working together, and offer concrete examples to developers looking to learn Irving's patterns and architecture.

It primarily contains examples of how to structure components in templates and template parts.
