# Quick Start
The quick start guide will get you a working Irving install using data from the [Irving Example Theme](?path=/docs/intro-wordpress--page#example-theme).

Check out the full [tutorial](/?path=/docs/tutorial-introduction--page) for a more in-depth introduction to Irving.

## Requirements/Assumptions
For this quick start guide, we assume you have,
* Node 12 and NPM 6 installed
* Some basic command line knowledge

## Clone the `create-irving-app` repo
We'll use the `~/code/` directory, but you can clone the [create-irving-app](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/create-irving-app) repo to any directory.

`git clone https://github.com/alleyinteractive/create-irving-app ~/code/irving-tutorial`

## Change directories into the site folder
`cd irving-tutorial`

## Set environment variables
Copy the environment variables from the example to your local `.env`,

`cp .env.example .env`

The required environment variables are,
* `ROOT_URL` - URL of the express server. Defaults to `http://localhost:3001`.
* `API_ROOT_URL` - URL of the components endpoint provider. We host this URL for demo/quick start purposes, `https://wordpress.irvingjs.com/wp-json/irving/v1`

Irving will open a new browser window at `http://localhost:3001` with your site.
