# What is Irving?
Irving Core is a React based, isomorphically rendered, headless frontend application to be used with a content management system (CMS). Irving allows quick and easy development of headless/decoupled websites.

In order to support development and production, there are a number of Irving packages, design/development patterns, and libraries that work together to create a powerful ecosystem of development tools.

Elevator Pitch
Irving takes a JSON string of components and hydrates React components. The frontend application makes a request to the API passing along the route details, which keeps the business logic in the backend/CMS layer. This allows for lightweight rendering and output without sacrificing any SPA functionality or foregoing and of React's advantages.
