# What is Irving?
Irving is a [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org) framework for headless/decoupled sites.

One of the promises of decoupled/headless applications is a separation between data, and presentation. Irving takes an alternative approach with the premise that **content and how it is presented are intertwined**.

With this approach, non-developers can easily control their data _and_ how it is displayed, while still enjoying the many benefits of a decoupled/headless application.
