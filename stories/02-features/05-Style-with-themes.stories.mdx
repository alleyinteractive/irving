# Styling with Themes

Themes are one of a variety of ways that styling can be applied in Irving. Themes are used in conjunction with [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) as an elegant and efficient way to include your styles. It's also possible to style using classNames and in-line styling (links tk for those sections).

### So, what's a theme?

The term "theme" is already in use in WordPress to refer to the overall shape and functioning of your site. Irving extends this concept of "theme" to each component meaning "a variant of styling." For a very simple example, if your application includes a red button and a blue button, you could apply a "red" theme to one and a "blue" theme to another.

## Theming Styled Components

An assortment of minimally styled components is included in Irving's [`styled-components` package](?path=/docs/features-available-packages--page#styled-components). Styles are easily overwritten by providing Irving with your own custom themes. 



Each styled-component's configuration includes a theme property that maps to the default style included in the component package. For example, the default.js theme for the container component is:

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';

/* eslint-disable import/prefer-default-export */
export const ContainerWrapper = styled.div`
  margin: auto;
  width: 100%;
`;
/* eslint-enable */

```
To find all the styled components available and their default themes, look in: `client/irving/node_modules/@irvinjs/styled-components/components` -- each component includes a `themes` folder containing a `default.js` file, which renders the basic "out of the box" styling.

The conditions needed to apply custom themes are:
* a `themes` folder must be created in the irving directory (`<projectName>/wp-content/themes/<projectTheme>/client/irving`) with an `index.js` file within. It's a good practice to organize your themes by component name, so to style a container, for example, create a `container` folder within the `themes` folder.
* a JavaScript file with your custom styling must be imported to the `themes/index.js` file.
* the styled-component in your template must point to your custom-theme.

The styled-components's `default.js` is the best place to start when writing your own theme so copy it from the `node_modules/@irvingjs/styled-components/components/<component-to-theme>/themes` folder. From there, add or subtract any styles you like. You can overwrite the default behavior by naming your custom theme `default.js` or keep the default behavior and add as many theme variants as you need.

For example, you might want a flex container around a section, that is 90% wide with a yellow background. In order to point your app to your custom theme, you would apply the "theme" prop to your component:

```json
{
  "name" : "irving/container",
  "theme" : "yellow-section"
}
```
Then create a folder for container themes and a file with your styling for this container theme called: `yellowSection.js`. Note that JavaScript requires camelCase names (yellowSection) which Irving will convert to hyphenated names in json (yellow-section).

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';

/* eslint-disable import/prefer-default-export */
export const ContainerWrapper = styled.section`
  background: yellow;
  display: flex;
  width: 90%;
`;
/* eslint-enable */

```
Your folder structure should look like this:
```
client\
  irving\
    themes\
      container\
        yellowSection.js
    index.js
    
```    

Next step: import your custom theme to the themes' folder `index.js` file:

```js
import * as yellowSection from './container/yellowSection';

export default {
  'irving/container': {
    yellowSection,
  }
}

```
That's it! A lovely feature of Irving is that as you noodle with your styling, the app hot reloads the styling without the need to refresh your browser. Very handy. However, templates and template parts are not hot-reloaded, so save and refresh after you have applied a theme to your component.

## Theming a WordPress component

Extending the styled-component theming plan, themes can also be applied to components in [WP Irving](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/wp-irving), the WordPress plug in to Irving. Components like post-list, site-menu, social sharing, etc., can be themed by determining the styled-component **alias** for that component and theming that component. 

For example, a post-title is text, hence `irving/post-title` aliases to `irving/text` and can be themed using a text theme, either one that already exists, like "h1" or one you make like "special-post-title". If it's not obvious what the alias might be, use the WordPress editor to check the component's API and you'll see something like this:

```json
{
"name": "irving/post-title",
"_alias": "irving/text",
...
}
```

or 

```json
{
"name": "irving/post-permalink",
"_alias": "irving/link",
...
},
```
which will help you to find the right styled component to theme.
