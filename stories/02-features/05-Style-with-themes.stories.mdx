# Theming a Styled Component

An assortment of minimally Styled Components is included in Irving' styled-components package. Styles are easily overwritten by providing Irving with your own custom themes. Each styled-component's configuration includes a theme property that maps to the default style included in the component package. For example, the default.js theme for the container component is:

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';

/* eslint-disable import/prefer-default-export */
export const ContainerWrapper = styled.div`
  margin: auto;
  width: 100%;
`;
/* eslint-enable */

```

The conditions needed to apply themes are:
* a `themes` folder must be created in the irving directory with an `index.js` file within. It's a good practice to organize your themes by component name, so to style a container, for example, create a `container` folder within the `themes` folder.
* a JavaScript file with your custom styling must to imported to the `index.js` file.
* the styled-component in your template must point to your custom-theme.

The styled-components's `default.js` is the best place to start when writing your own theme so copy it from `node_modules/@irvingjs/styled-components/components/<component-to-theme>/themes`. From there, add or subtract any styles you like. You can overwrite the default behavior by naming your custom theme `default.js` or keep the default behavior and add as many theme variants as you need.

For example, you might want a flex container around a section, that is 90% wide with a yellow background. In order to point your app to your custom theme, you would apply the "theme" prop to your component:

```json
{
  "name" : "irving/container",
  "theme" : "yellow-section"
}
```
Then create a folder for container themes and a file with your styling for this container theme called: `yellowSection.js`. Note that JavaScript requires camelCase names (yellowSection) which Irving will convert to hyphenated names in json (yellow-section).

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';

/* eslint-disable import/prefer-default-export */
export const ContainerWrapper = styled.section`
  background: yellow;
  display: flex;
  width: 90%;
`;
/* eslint-enable */

```
Your folder structure should look like this:
```
client\
  irving\
    themes\
      container\
        yellowSection.js
    index.js
    
```    

Next step: import your custom theme to the themes' folder `index.js` file:

```js
import * as yellowSection from './container/yellowSection';

export default {
  'irving/container': {
    yellowSection,
  }
}

```
That's it! A lovely feature of Irving is that as you noodle with your styling, the app hot reloads the styling without the need to refresh your browser. Very handy. However, templates and template parts are not hot-reloaded, so save and refresh after you have applied a theme to your component.
