# Request Lifecycle
The purpose of this section is to describe the different parts of Irving, and how you can expect a typical request to work.

## TLDR;
1. Irving asks WP Irving for
1. Irving passes the requested URL to WP Irving.
1. The
1. WordPress runs the same routing and WP_Query logic as a traditinal theme.
1. The Components Endpoint constructs a response in JSON.
1. Irving renders the proper React components for that JSON response.

## In a bit more detail
In a nutshell, Irving passes the URL being requested to WP Irving, which describes a tree of Components

1. User requests `irvingjs.com/about-us/`, the frontend Irving application parses this request.
1. Irving does a `fetch` against your Components Endpoint, `irving/v1/components?path=/about-us/`.
1. This triggers WP Irving to run a `WP_Query` against this path, mimicing native WordPress.
1. The appropriate `/template/${template}.json` file is loaded based on the WordPress Template Hierarchy.
1. That file is hydrated and sent back to the Node application.
1. Irving parses the response, finding the appropriate React component using the Component Map.
1. Irving renders each React component as per the Components Endpoint.

## Irving Application Request
User requests will be processed differently depending on whether the user is coming from an external or internal URL. We'll use a site called `example.com` as an example.

### Request 1 (external URL, rendered server-side)
* User enters `example.com` into their URL bar
* User request hits the Irving node server
* [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) handles the request. Note: _all_ requests are handled the same way by express, actual path-based routing is offloaded to your CMS. For more info see the [server docs](?path=/docs/concepts-express--page)
* Express passes off the request into Irving's `serverRenderer` function.
* `serverRenderer` triggers a [`history.push`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/history) call, which in turn dispatches a `LOCATION_CHANGE` action.
* `redux-saga` picks up the `LOCATION_CHANGE` action and handles a request to your CMS containing the requested path (`/`).
* Response data from your CMS is merged into redux state and passed into the app to be rendered.
* `serverRenderer` uses the initial redux state to render a `.ejs` template for either an error (if an error occurs at the node/express level) or the app. This render includes a variable on `window` containing the initial state of the app.
* User gets the rendered HTML for `example.com`

### Request 2 (internal URL, rendered client-side)
* User clicks on a link leading to `/posts/lorem-ipsum` within `example.com`
* Irving triggers a [`history.push`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/history), which in turn dispatches a `LOCATION_CHANGE` action.
* `redux-saga` picks up the `LOCATION_CHANGE` action and handles a request to your CMS containing the requested path (`/posts/lorem-ipsum`)
* Response data from your CMS is merged into redux state.
* App is re-rendered using new data.
* Users sees the rendered HTML for `/posts/lorem-ipsum`

As you can see, the pathway for initial requests is significantly longer than that of subsequent requests. This is one of the primary performance advantages for Irving over a more traditionally-rendered app.
