# Express
Irving's express server is set up somewhat differently than you might expect from a normal express app. While a normal express app might route different requests to different handles, Irving uses a single handler for all requests. The reason for this is Irving is intended to work primarily as a drop-in replacement for a CMS's default render layer. As such, Irving relies on your CMS's built-in routing to handle requests appropriately instead of doing so on its own.

In practice, this means the only distinctions you need to be aware of in express request handling are those between `development` and `production` environments.

## Development
* Uses [`webpack-dev-middleware`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware) to directly serve webpack assets.
* [`webpack-hot-middleware`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-hot-middleware) is used to hot reload client-side assets.
* In addition, [`webpack-hot-server-middleware`](https://github.com/60frames/webpack-hot-server-middleware) is used to handle server-executed hot reloading.

## Production
* Uses the server-side webpack bundle to handle all user requests.
* Adds optional basic auth using the [`basic-auth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basic-auth) package
* Aggressively caches the client side bundle using `express.static`
