# Server Performance and Scaling
One of the primary features of Irving is its ability to scale gracefully. In an ideal Irving project most (if not all) of the business logic is offloaded to the API layer. This keeps Irving performant and optimized for speed.

Irving's pros and cons around performance and scaling are going to be true for any node application. Standard best-practices for deploying a node application apply.

Here are some resources to consider and become familiar with,
* [Best Practices for Node.js Development](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-best-practices), Heroku Documentation

## Scaling
Scaling with Irving is similar to horizontal scaling for any Node application. We recommend a load balancer with caching that would distribute traffic amongst any number of node processes.

* A typical high traffic Irving application has ram requirements of less than 512mb.
* Typically you should run multiple node processes distributed behind a caching proxy (ex. Varnish).
  - Smaller environments could consider [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) for running multiple node processes.
* Ensure that every node process shares a single caching instance (see [caching](Caching)).

### Gotchas
Just as with any React-based application, there are a few issues to consider,
* NPM is a double edged sword. Using NPM packages will help speed development and offer great functionality, but the size of the production bundle will increase as a result. As with other node applications like Irving, the bundle will need to download fully and can create a bottleneck (we recommend caching your bundle).
