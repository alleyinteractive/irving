# WordPress Features
This section documents WordPress features that are supported in Irving.

## Custom Logo
Upload your logo via the Customizer, and use the `irving/site-logo` [(docs)](?path=/docs/wordpress-components-site-logo--page) component in your template.

[WordPress Documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/custom-logo/)

## Favicon
Upload your favicon to the Customizer, and Irving handles the rest.

[WordPress Documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/article/creating-a-favicon/)

## Feeds
WordPress feeds are supported via [proxy](?path=/docs/features-proxies--page).

[WordPress Documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-feeds/)

## Previews
To enable previews, you must install and enabled the [JWT Auth plugin](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/integrations-supported-wordpress-plugins--page#jwt-auth).

Coming soon, unauthenticated previews.

## Sitemaps
The [@irvingjs/wordpress](?path=/docs/features-proxies--page#wordpress) pacakage will automatically proxy any `.xml` files, including `sitemap.xml`. This is one of the few situations where nearly any plugin or solution you use should work. We've tested with [Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/support/sitemaps/), [MSM](https://github.com/Automattic/msm-sitemap), and [WordPress Core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/22/new-xml-sitemaps-functionality-in-wordpress-5-5/).

## Widgets
We do not currently support widgets.
