# Security

## Ensuring a secure connection
In production HTTPS will typically be handled by the load balancer of the hosting environment.

### Local Development
If you would like HTTPS for local development set the following environment variables.
* `HTTPS_KEY_PATH` - Path to your HTTPS key.
* `HTTPS_CERT_PATH` - Path to your HTTPS cert.

For more details on generating a certificate, see [Express' documentation](https://timonweb.com/posts/running-expressjs-server-over-https/).
