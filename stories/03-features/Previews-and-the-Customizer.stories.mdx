# Previews and the Customizer
This section details content previews and Customizer support.

## WordPress Content
We do our best to replicate WordPress Core's support for post and page previews. Because this content is not public, you must have [authentication](?path=/docs/features-authentication--page) enabled.

## WordPress Customizer
Settings that use the [Customizer](https://wordpress.com/support/customizer/) should work as expected, however live preview using the Customizer is currently unsupported. Full support is expected for a future release.
