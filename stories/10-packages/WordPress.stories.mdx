# WordPress
This package contains a number of helpers for working with a WordPress backend:
* Integration for displaying the WP Admin Bar.
* Helpers for setting up Gutenberg block styles.
* Configuration for commonly-used passthrough proxies for a WordPress backend.

## Installation
1. `npm install @irvingjs/wordpress`
2. Add the `@irvingjs/worpdress` componentMap to your project's `componentMap.js`:

```javascript
// Import it from the package.
import { componentMap } from '@irvingjs/wordpress';

// Ensure it's included in the export.
export default {
  ...componentMap,
};
```
3. If using the `BlockStyles` component, you will need to add this component in the location of your choice in your JSON template yourself. It's name in the component map is `irving/block-styles`.
4. No additional steps are necessary to display the admin bar component.

## Features of this package
This package contains several handy and commonly-used features for using Irving with WordPress: a WP Admin Bar component, a component for syling Gutenberg blocks, and some configuration presets specific to the WordPress backend.

### Admin Bar
This component displays the familiar WP Admin Bar for logged-in users. This is accomplished via an iframe to wp-admin, sized approrpriately to only display the admin bar.

As mentioned above, this component will automatically be added to your components endpoint for logged-in users. The only additional step you need to take to get the Admin Bar to display is adding the `@irvingjs/wordpress` component map to your own project's component map, as illustrated in the _Installation_ section above.

### Block Styles
This package also comes with a solution for styling Gutenberg blocks and sharing those styles between both wp-admin and your Irving front-end. Below are details on how you can configure and extend this functionality.

#### Setup
In order to get the block styles functionality set up, you will need to:
* Add the `@irvingjs/wordpress` component map to your own component map (see the _Installation_ section above)
* Add the `irving/block-styles` component to your template(s) of choice. This component renders global styles and nothing else, so it can appear anywhere in a template.
* This package will generate a `blockEditor.js` file during your usual Irving build, which will automatically be enqueued in wp-admin. If you are actively developing block styles, be sure to run `npm run dev` locally while you do so otherwise block styles will not build and the `blockEditor.js` file will 404 in wp-admin.

#### Configuring block styles
There are two primary ways of configuring block styles:
* Set up a `styles/blocks.json` in your WordPress theme to provide new CSS property values to the default block styles in this package. Site theme values are roughly organized by block, as are styled components for each block. Search in the `components/blockStyles/blocks` directory of this package to find what site theme properties are configurable for specific blocks. Example for changing the color of links:
```json
// styles/blocks.json
{
  "link": {
    "color": "red"
  }
}
```
* Your second option is to create your own styled component(s) to completely override the default styles in this package. Block styles can be configured in this way by creating a `blockStyles.config.js` in the root directory of your irving project. This file should export an config object, for which there are currently two available fields:
  * `blockMap` (Object) - Add your own styled components to style a specific block. Keys in this object are a block name, values are strings, string templates, or instances of the styled components [`css` helper](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#css). Example:
  ```javascript
  import paragraphStyles from 'components/blocks/paragraph';

  export default {
    blockMap: {
      'core/paragraph': paragraphStyles,
    },
  };
  ```
  * `mergeBlockStyles` (Boolean) - **Experimental** - Load both default styles and custom styles declared in the above `blockMap` field. The usual CSS cascade might not work the way you expect here. In certain circumstances defaults may be loaded before your custom styles, and in other circumstances vice-versa.
