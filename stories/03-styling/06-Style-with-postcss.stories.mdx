# Styling with PostCSS
Irving allows you to style components with PostCSS by way of a package. PostCSS is a CSS parser and preprocessor written in JavaScript with a rich ecosystem of plugins. This doc will help you get started using PostCSS.

## Setting up PostCSS in your project
Preparing your project to use PostCSS is a two step process:
1. `npm install @irvingjs/postcss` - install the Irving `postcss` package as a dependency for your project.
2. Import the package configuration and add it to your project's config. To do this, first create an `irving.config.js` in your project's root directory. In this file, add the following:
```js
import postcssConfig from '@irvingjs/postcss';

export default {
    packages: [
        postcssConfig,
    ],
};
```

## Configuring PostCSS and adding plugins
Out of the box Irving is configured to use [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), but you can modify this default setup. Further information on Irving configuration can be found in the [configuration docs](?path=/docs/architecture-configuration--page#postcss-configuration). Below are a couple examples of how you might want to configure PostCSS:

### Adding to the Irving's default configuration
If you'd like to simply add config fields or plugins to the default Irving configuration, you can do so by creating a `config/postcss.config.js` file in your project and exporting a PostCSS config object. This object will be merged into the default config. Be sure to use `module.exports` in this file as it will only be run in a node environment. Example:

```js
const myPlugin = require('my-plugin');

module.exports = {
    // This plugin will be concatenated to the default array of plugins.
    plugins: [
        myPlugin()
    ],
};
```

### Modifying the default configuration
To modify the default configuration, create a PostCSS config file as described above, but this time export a function. This function will receive the default configuration as a parameter and expect a valid PostCSS configuration in return. Example:

```js
const myPlugin = require('my-plugin');

module.exports = (defaultConfig) => {
    // Your plugins array will replace the default plugins array entirely.
    return {
        ...defaultConfig,
        plugins: [
            myPlugin(),
        ],
    };
};
```
