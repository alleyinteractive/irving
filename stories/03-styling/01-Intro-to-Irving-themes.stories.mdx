# Styling with Themes
Themes are an extension to styling in Irving that allow for more complex, reusable, encapsulated groupings of styles for a particular component. Themes can be used in conjunction with the `@irvingjs/styled` package or with Irving's core styling setup as an elegant and efficient way to include your styles.

## So, what's a theme?
A theme in the Irving sense can be one of two things, depending on whether or not you're using the `@irvingjs/styled` package:
* Using `@irvingjs/styled`, themes are a method of replacing one or more styled components in an Irving component's JSX with your own.
* Using `@irvingjs/core` alone, themes are a method of replacing one or more classnames in a component's stylesheet with your own.

Irving's theming functionality may not work quite the way you expect from other themeing methods you have used in the past, and should not be confused with the [`theme` functionality built in to Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming). Styled Components' built-in theming can be used as well, but is entirely separate from Irving's themes.

## How do I start using themes?
You can get started with themes in several ways, each of which are outlined in subsequent pages of the styling section of Irving's documentation:
* [Theming with CSS and CSS Modules](/docs/styling-theme-with-css--page) - Get started adding themes to your custom components using Irving Core's built-in higher-order component, `withThemes`.
* [Theming with Styled Components](/docs/styling-theme-with-styled-components--page) - Learn how to add themes to existing components in the `@irvingjs/styled-components` library or add themes to your own custom components via the `withThemes` higher-order component in the `@irvingjs/styled` package.
