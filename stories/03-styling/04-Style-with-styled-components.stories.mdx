# Styling with Styled Components
Irving's most broadly-supported method of styling is [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), a popular CSS-in-JS library. The core benefits of Styled Components are:
* Critical CSS with no extra effort.
* Locally-scoped classNames (similar to what you get with CSS Modules).
* Easy to optimize and remove unnecessary styles, as all styles are attached to a component.
* All the benefits of CSS-in-JS, including dynamic styles that respond to changes in props.
* Automatic vendor prefixing.
