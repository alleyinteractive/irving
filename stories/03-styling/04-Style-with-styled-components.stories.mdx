# Styling with Styled Components
Irving's most broadly-supported method of styling is [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), a popular CSS-in-JS library. The core benefits of Styled Components are:
* Critical CSS with no extra effort.
* Locally-scoped classNames (similar to what you get with CSS Modules).
* Easy to optimize and remove unnecessary styles, as all styles are attached to a component.
* All the benefits of CSS-in-JS, including dynamic styles that respond to changes in props.
* Automatic vendor prefixing.

Check out [Styled Components' documentation](https://styled-components.com/docs) for more details on how to use them.

## Setting up Styled Components in your project
Preparing your project to use styled components is a two step process:
1. `npm install @irvingjs/styled` - install the Irving `styled` package as a dependency for your project.
2. Import the package configuration and add it to your project's config. To do this, first create an `irving.config.js` in your project's root directory. In this file, add the following:
```js
import styledConfig from '@irvingjs/styled';

export default {
    packages: [
        styledConfig,
    ],
};
```

## Using Irving's library of styled components
Set up for usage of the `@irvingjs/styled-components` package is identical to the setup for `@irvingjs/styled`. After installing the package, add the folowing to your `irving.config.js` file:
```js
import styledComponentsConfig from '@irvingjs/styled-components';

export default {
    packages: [
        styledComponentsConfig,
    ],
};
```
