# Inline styling WordPress templates

To help developers quickly prototype styles while writing templates, a style prop is available to use in the component config. The style properties assigned will appear as inline styles. Whether you move styles to a theme once design is settled is up to you and your team's code organization norms.

To implement some style properties, simply list them as a `style` object in the `config` prop. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "irving/text",
  "config": {
    "tag": "h4",
    "style": {
      "margin-bottom": "1rem",
      "color": "grey"
    },
    "content": "some text"
  }
}
```
renders "some text" with color and margin.

Although most components can be rendered using themes, inline styling is currently the only way to style `styled-css-grid/grid` [(docs)](?path=/docs/wordpress-components-styled-css-grid-grid--page) and `styled-css-grid/cell` [(docs)](?path=/docs/wordpress-components-styled-css-grid-cell--page) as these components rely on a dependent package.
