# Component Mapping

Irving maps components in the API to React components on the frontend via a component map (`componentMap.js`). Irving core includes a prebuilt component map to get you started. Components will not render unless they appear in the component map.

To map an API component to a React component, identify the name of each component and add them as a key-value pair to the component map.

## Identifying the name of an API component

Each API component has a name key that takes a string as a value. In the example below the name of our API component is "byline." Usually API names are lower case single words or use hyphens in the case of multi-word names ('menu-item').

```json
{
  "name": "byline",
  "config": {
   "link": "https://localhost:3001/author/alley/",
   "name": "alley"
  },
  "children": [],
}
```

## Identifying the name of a React component

The name of the React component in the example below is "Byline." React component names are usually capitalized single words; when then names contain more than one word, they are often camel-cased ('MenuItem').

```jsx
export const Byline = (props) => {
  const {
    link,
    name,
  } = props;

  return (
    <div className={styles.wrapper}>
      <Link to={link} className={styles.link}>
        <span className={styles.name}>{name}</span>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
};
```
## Mapping The Components

To map, the component, open your `componentMap.js`file, located in the `config` directory.

Next, add your API component and React component to the `componentMap` object below the import statement. You may also re-map Irving core components to a new key or import core components that are no included in the map to begin with. Irving core includes a handy `@component` alias for importing components (illustrated below).

```js
import Byline from 'components/byline';
import Link from '@components/link';

/**
  * Defines which React component to render for each received API component.
  */
const componentMap = {
  'my-link': Link,
  byline: Byline,
};

export default componentMap;
```

A React component can map to more than one API component. Each API component can map to only one React component.
