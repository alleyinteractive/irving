# Multisite Support
This section outlines how to configure Irving to support multiple different sites using a single instance.

## Overview
A single instance of Irving is capable (since version 5.2.0) of serving multiple different URLs. Irving will query a different backend API root URL conditionally based on the incoming hostname in the HTTP request. Each backend host should be configured to be compatible with the same component map.

The `ROOT_URL` and `API_ROOT_URL` environment variables defined in the `.env` file are the default values for the frontend and backend API root URLs. Optionally, these can be overridden by creating a config file named `multisite.config.js` in the Irving project root. If present, it is possible to override the `ROOT_URL` and `API_ROOT_URL` values at run time for matching hostnames.

When Irving is transpiled, only the `.env` file variables are available in the `process.env` object. Multisite support uses a wrapper object around the base environment variables. The overridden variables are only available through this method, which also requires the `window.location.href` global to be set.

## Configuration File
The `multisite.config.js` file should be created alongside the main `irving.config.js` file, in the project root directory. This file exports an array of objects with the following shape:

```javascript
const config = [
  {
    domain: 'test-site.example.com',
    env: {
      API_ROOT_URL: 'https://test-site-api.example.com/wp-json/irving/v1',
      ROOT_URL: 'https://test-site.example.com',
    },
  },
  {
    domain: 'another-site.example.com',
    env: {
      API_ROOT_URL: 'https://another-site-api.example.com/wp-json/irving/v1',
      ROOT_URL: 'https://another-site.example.com',
    },
  },
];

module.exports = config;
```

The `domain` key is used to match the value of the incoming hostname. If the hostname matches any in the array, the keys and values in the `vars` object will supersede any equivalent keys in the `.env` file. While at a minimum the `API_ROOT_URL` and `ROOT_URL` variables must be set to enable multisite behavior, it is possible to override any other environment variable, or add extra variables.

If the none of the `domain` keys match the current hostname, the defaults in the `.env` file will apply.
