# Components in WP Irving


## Core component types

To aid in quickly creating layouts, the WP-Irving plugin includes a set of registered component types, which can used in template files, that automatically pull in data from WordPress so you don't have to write a lot of back-end code to get your templates up and running. The full list of available component types can be found here: https://github.com/alleyinteractive/wp-irving/tree/master/inc/components/components.

## Register custom component types

In addition to the core components, projects can create and register their own component types using the `WP_Irving\Components\register_components()` function.

Ex:
```
<?php
/**
 * Example component registration.
 */

WP_Irving\Components\register_component(
	'namespace/example-component',
	[
		// Define default configuration schema for the component.
		'config'            => [
			'property' => [
				'type'    => 'bool',
				'default' => false,
			],
		],
		'config_callback'   => function ( $config ) {

			/*
			 * Add custom logic that hydrates the component's 
			 * configuration properties with WP data.
			 */

			return $config;
		},
		'children_callback' => function ( $children, $config ) {

			/*
			 * Add custom logic that modifies the component's
			 * children array based on configuration properties.
			 */

			return $children;
		},
	]
);
```

You can also register components using the `WP_Irving\Components\register_component_from_config()` function and pass a path to a JSON file defining the component's schema (see examples of registering from JSON schema in the core components library).
