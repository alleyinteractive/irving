# Authentication

## Basic Authentication
Basic auth can be enabled by enabling two environment variables. They will automatically apply the Authorization header for requests to the app. This will prompt the user to enter the valid credentials to access the site.

* `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME`
* `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`

## WordPress Authentication
Coming soon.

### Challenges with Authentication
Authentication in WordPress uses cookies out of the box. While Irving Core does pass your cookies through the Components API, the WordPress REST API also requires a nonce to fully authenticate (this is ignoring the issue of cross-domain cookies).

### Using the JWT plugin
Coming soon.
