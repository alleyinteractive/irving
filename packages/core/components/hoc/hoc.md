Documentation for Irving's collection of higher-order components. Irving offers higher-order components for a few common purposes:
* Displaying a loading UI based on a boolean `loading` property in redux state
* Controlling a form's state and submitting that form to an API, if required.
* Switching visual themes for a component using context, preventing the need for passing down props through the entire component tree to a deeply-nested child component.
