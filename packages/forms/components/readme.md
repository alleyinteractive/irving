Irving offers a collection of components for getting you started with building forms. In core Irving, we aim to expedite form development by providing three elements:
* Basic form components for text inputs, radio buttons, selects, etc. These are located in the `components/form` directory.
* A higher order component in `components/hoc/withFormHandler.js` for setting a default form state and subsequently controlling and updating that state.
* A saga, service, reducer, and collection of actions for managing form submissions and integrating validation and error responses.
