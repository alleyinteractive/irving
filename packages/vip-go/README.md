# VIP Go node server setup
This package contains implementations of WordPress VIP's helpers for caching, logging, and monitoring with Newrelic.

## Installation
1. `npm install @irvingjs/vip-go`
2. Add the VIP Go package configuration to your local project configuration files:
In your `irving.config.js` file:
```javascript
import vipGoConfig from '@irvingjs/vip-go';

const config = {
  packages: [
    vipGoConfig,
  ]
}

export default config;
```

In your `irving.config.server.js` file:
```javascript
const vipGoConfig = require('@irvingjs/vip-go');

module.exports = {
  packages: [
    vipGoConfig,
  ]
}
```
3. Update your `package.json` to include the VIP Go preflight checks and the vip-go-friendly build script:
```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "preflight": "npx @automattic/vip-go-preflight-checks",
        "build": "if [ -z $VIP_GO_APP_ID ]; then npm run webpack; else exit 0; fi",
    }
}
```
