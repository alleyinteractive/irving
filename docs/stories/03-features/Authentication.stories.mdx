# Authentication

## Application Authentication
This requires authorization to load the Irving Irving application. This is good for staging/development sites.

### Basic Authentication
When enabled, this will apply the `Authorization` header for requests to the app. This will prompt the user to enter the valid credentials to access the site.

Basic auth can be enabled using [environment variables](?path=/docs/configuration-environment-variables--page#basic-auth).

## WordPress Adapter Authentication
This allows your users to authenticate against the adapter.

In a WordPress context, this enables the [admin bar](), [previews](), and the use of functions like `is_user_logged_in()` ([docs](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/is_user_logged_in/)).

### How it works
In order to ensure authenticated requests aren't cached, every initial server-side render will be un-authenticated.

Once the Irving application is hydrated, it will check for an auth cookie set by WP Irving. If present, Irving will re-run the components endpoint `fetch`, this time including the auth bearer token in the cookie.

This authenticates the user to WordPress.

### Techniques

#### Application Passwords
With the release of WordPress 5.6 coming soon, we'll be adding native support for Application Passwords.

#### WordPress `WP-API/jwt-auth` plugin
Until then, we offer authentication via the [WP-API/jwt-auth plugin](https://github.com/WP-API/jwt-auth/).

##### Setup
* Install and enable the plugin [(repo)](https://github.com/WP-API/jwt-auth/).
* Ensure your cross-domain is setup correctly using the `wp_irving_jwt_token_cookie_domain` hook [(docs)](?path=/docs/configuration-wordpress--page#jwt-token-cookie-domain).
