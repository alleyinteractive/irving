You may also need the `APP_ROOT` variable, which should be `/app`.

### Other settings
There may be other environment variables or domains you want mapped in Heroku. Refer to the official [Heroku docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) for more info.

## Initial Deploy
Once you've setup your app, you can do the initial deploy (and optionally auto deploy).

You'll see the build output in the console. Assuming your build doesn't have any errors, you'll see a success message!
