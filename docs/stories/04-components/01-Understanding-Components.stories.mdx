# What is a Component?
In an effort to simplify the entire application, we extend the concept of a React Component to the API and data layer. By mapping out our data in the API in the form a component tree, the Irving application can remain simple and unaware of context/information it doesn't need.

By using a robust API with a simple routing strategy, Irving allows quick and easy development of headless websites. The concept behind Irving is to offload as much work as possible to the CMS/API layer.

## Study the API component in an endpoint.
* Does the component exist in the expected endpoint?
* Does it contain the expected name, config, children, and componentGroups?
* Are the values of the name, config, children, and componentGroups as expected? Are the values the correct types?

Having a clean, well-organized API component in the endpoint smooths the way for creating your component in Irving.

Any errors in your API component in the endpoint may block your progress, so resolve those before proceeding.

Keep a browser tab with your endpoint open as you create your component in Irving.

In this example, we're going to build a Byline component. Its API component has this shape

```json
{
  "name": "byline",
  "config": {
   "link": "https://localhost:3001/author/alley/",
   "name": "alley"
  },
  "children": [],
  "componentGroups": {
    "default:": []
  }
}
```
