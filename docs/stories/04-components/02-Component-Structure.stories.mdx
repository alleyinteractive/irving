# Component Structure
The purpose of this page is to document the Irving component structure.

Example,
```json
{
	"name": "irving/body-wrapper",
	"_alias": "irving/container",
	"config": {
		"max_width": "large"
	},
	"children": []
}
```

### `name` - String
A unique slug for your component. Follows a `{namespace}/{name}` format in dash case.

### `_alias` - String (experimental)
Allows you to alias your rendering to a different component.

For example, you may have default wrappers named `irving/header-wrapper`, `irving/body-wrapper`, `irving/footer-wrapper`. Rather than creating a new componentMap entry for each one, you can render using `irving/fragment` by setting the alias property.

### `config` - Object
The config property is passed along to the React component as `props`.

### `children` - Array
An array of other components or strings that render as React components or text nodes. This gets merged into the `props` object upon rendering, and is accessible as `props.children`.
