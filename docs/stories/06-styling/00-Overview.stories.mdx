# Writing Styles in Irving
This section outlines the different approaches in applying frontend styles to your site.

Irving offers several methods of writing styles for your project depending on your preferences and needs.

## Intro to Themes
Themes are an extension to styling in Irving that allow for more complex, reusable, encapsulated groupings of styles for a particular component. Themes can be used in conjunction with the `@irvingjs/styled` package or with Irving's core styling setup as an elegant and efficient way to include your styles.

## CSS Modules and PostCSS
This is the mode of writing styles that Irving offers out of the box. This is plain ol' vanilla CSS stylesheets with added [CSS Modules functionality via `css-loader`](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/#modules).

Irving supports [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) via the [`@irvingjs/postcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@irvingjs/postcss) package, allowing you to leverage the wealth of plugins in the PostCSS ecosystem to further optimize your stylesheets.
