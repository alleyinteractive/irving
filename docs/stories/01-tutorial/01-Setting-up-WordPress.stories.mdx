# Setting up WordPress
In this section, we'll configure your WordPress installation to work with the Irving application created in the [Quick Start Guide](?path=/docs/intro-quick-start--page).

Before you get started, you'll also need a local copy of WordPress. The WordPress documentation on [how to install WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/) is a good resource to get started.

## Install and activate the WP Irving plugin
First, we want to download, install, and activate the [WP Irving](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/wp-irving) plugin on your local installation.

You should immediately see a new "Irving Development" dropdown in your [admin bar](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/packages-wordpress--page#admin-bar).

You can confirm the endpoint is setup correctly by visiting `yourdomain.com/wp-json/irving/v1` and looking for `"namespace": "irving/v1"`.

You should see a response similar to this,
```json
  {
  "namespace": "irving/v1",
  "routes": {
    "/irving/v1": {
      "namespace": "irving/v1",
      "methods": [...],
      "endpoints": [...],
      "_links": {...}
    },
    "/irving/v1/components": {...},
    "/irving/v1/registered-components": {...},
    "/irving/v1/purge-cache": {...}
  },
  "_links": {...}
  }
```

If you get a `rest_no_route` error, double check your plugin is activated and [pretty permalinks](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-permalinks/) are enabled.

```json
{
  "code": "rest_no_route",
  "message": "No route was found matching the URL and request method",
  "data": {
    "status": 404
  }
}
```

## Update `API_ROOT_URL` in `.env`
Now that we've confirmed WP Irving is setup and ready, replace `API_ROOT_URL` in your `.env`,

```bash
API_ROOT_URL=https://your-local-wp-site.com/wp-json/irving/v1
```

_You'll need to restart Irving if it's already running._

## Update Site Address in WordPress
Next, we want to update the [Site Address](https://wordpress.org/support/article/changing-the-site-url/) in WordPresss. This can be done by navigating to `Settings -> General` in WordPress admin.

We'll use the value of `ROOT_URL` in  `~/code/irving-tutorial/.env`, which is `http://localhost:3001` by default.

## Confirm your Changes
From `~/code/irving-tutorial/` (or your custom location), run `npm run dev` and you should see a "Welcome to Irving" message.

<img src="/assets/img/tutorial/01/welcome.png" style={{maxWidth: "600px", margin: "auto", width: "100%", display: "flex"}} />

## Download and install the Irving Starter Theme
Similar to `create-irving-app` in the Quick Start Guide, we also have an `irving-starter-theme` ([repo](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/irving-starter-theme)) to help kickstart your WordPress theme. It includes the basic structure of the `/templates/` and `/template-parts/` folders for an Irving-ready WordPress theme.

WP Irving looks for `.json` files in `/your-theme/templates/` that match the [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/). This means when you navigate to a single post, `single.json` is loaded, hydrated, and sent in the response (see the Irving [Request Life Cycle](?path=/docs/concepts-request-life-cycle--page#the-request-is-parsed-and-used-to-hydrate-a-template)).

Example WordPress theme structure for an Irving site:
```
wp-content
│
└───your-theme
    │   functions.php
    │   index.php
    │   style.css
    │
    └───templates
    │       archive.json
    │       author.json
    │       defaults.json
    │       frontpage.json
    │       index.json
    │       page.json
    │       single.json
    │
    └───template-parts
            header.json
            footer.json
```

## Up Next
We'll add components to the `/templates/single.json` file to scaffold the post template.
